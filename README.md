# Blind-Jump
Blind Jump is a space themed action-adventure game that I've been working on. When reading my code, I recommend starting with the GameMap class header and then the corresponding .cpp file, and then looking through the class files for the member objects declared in GameMap.hpp. The main file does not have very much going on (by design), it just creates a window and a GameMap and goes into a drawing loop.
If you're interested in how I implemented procedural generation, take a look at mappingFunctions.cpp. For video links refer to the brief description here: http://evanbowman.github.io/blindjumpinfo.html
