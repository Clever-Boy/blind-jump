# Blind-Jump
Blind Jump is a space themed action-adventure game that I've been working on. When reading my code, I recommend starting with the mapInit class header and then the corresponding .cpp file, and then looking through the class files for the member objects declared in mapInit.h. The main file does not have very much going on (by design), it just creates a couple of objects and then goes into the main drawing loop.
If you're interested in how I implemented procedural generation, take a look at mappingFunctions.cpp. Also refer to the brief description here: http://evanbowman.github.io/blindjumpinfo.html
