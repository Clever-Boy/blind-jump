			       OVERVIEW
		 
Blind Jump  is a  simple procedurally  generated space  adventure game
that I've been working on for fun  in my free time.  The object of the
game is  to get  to the  teleporter at  the end  of each  level, while
battling monsters  and evil robots. Check  out this clip to  see it in
action: https://youtu.be/jQRcmj-kvgc


			       BUILDING	  

If you're not interested in messing  with the source code, and you run
macOS or Linux, skip to the  steps below for installing the apropriate
pre-compiled binaries.

If you're still  reading this section, it's time to  set up your build
environment for compiling locally! If  you don't have CMake installed,
or your  version of CMake is  older than v3.5, get  the newest version
with your  favorite package manager  (CMake version can be  checked by
running cmake --version).

Next, you should  set up the SFML library (version  2.4 or newer). You
can download it here: http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.4.0/

Finally, you'll need a C++14  compatible compiler. On linux you should
have gotten a copy of the gnu toolchain packaged with your distro (but
you may need to update gcc).  For macOS, install Command Line Tools if
you haven't already, which should get you an up-to-date copy of clang.
In Windows, I personally would recommend installing MinGW, as it would
make the  steps below easier  to follow, but  if you know  what you're
doing Visual Studio may well be enough.

After cloning this repository, navigate to the build directory in your
terminal and  type "cmake .". Now  run "make". This should  produce an
executable called blindjump in the current directory.
