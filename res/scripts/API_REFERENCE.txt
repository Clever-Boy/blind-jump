BLIND JUMP API REFRENCE 0.0.1

The Blind Jump core engine exposes a bunch of functions on the Lua
side of things, their scemantics and calling conventions are provided
here for your convenience.


game.getScreenSize() -> number, number

Returns the width and height of the monitor displaying the game
visuals.


game.registerEnemyClass(classname) -> none

Registers an enemy class with the engine. Enemy classes are tables
that are expected to implement three functions: OnCreate, OnUpdata,
and OnDestroy. Each of these functions should take one parameter, to
which the game will bind the address of the caller on the engine side
of things so that a specific instance of the class can be mutated.


game.getDeltaTime() -> number

Returns the time elapsed since the last logic update, in microseconds.


game.createInstance(classname) -> light userdata

Takes the name of a class previously declared with
game.registerEnemyClass(), and returns a reference to the newly
instanciated instance of that class.
